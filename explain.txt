Similar to the data set titled small_noerrors, this dataset represents a situation where the data set includes ALL entries with either silicon or iron set to -1. This dataset is useful in the edge case where no data values are printed and all entries are added tot the "Bad Sectors" category. While unlikely, some abnormal behavior could arise from this scenario and it could be valuable to check for this possibility.
